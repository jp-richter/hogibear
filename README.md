# logibearGoesHaskell

Simple propositional logic parser with methods to manipulate and evaluate logic expressions. 

Transforming Expressions:

  - to Negation Normal Form
  - to Conjunctive Normal Form
  - to Disjunctive Normal Form
  - to Implicative Form

Evaluating Expressions:

  - check if expression is a valid Horn Form
  - check if expression is Horn satisfiable
  - check if expression is renamable to a Horn satisfiable expression
  
Roadmap:

  - add propositional logic resolution algorithms
  - add support for modal and predicate logic
